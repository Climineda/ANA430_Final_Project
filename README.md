It focuses on three metrics across multiple countries:  
- PM2.5 Air Pollution  
- Population Size  
- Hospital Beds per 1,000 people  

The project was created as part of the Signature Assignment for National University's ANA430 – Advanced Data Visualization course.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Plotly & Dash
- World Bank API
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

## How It Works
- Fetches live data via the World Bank API
- Cleans and prepares the dataset
- Builds new metrics like PM2.5 per 1,000 people
- Produces correlation visualizations and time-series graphs
- Presents the results in an interactive Dash app with dropdown filters
